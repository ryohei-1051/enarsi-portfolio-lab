- `show ip int brief` (target interfaces are **up/up**)
- `ping` to the directly-connected peer (link reachability)
- `show ip ospf neighbor` (neighbors are **FULL**)
- `show ip ospf interface <if>` (area / auth / hello-dead / MTU)
- `show ip route ospf` (expected OSPF routes installed)
- `traceroute` (expected path)
- *(Optional)* link down/up to validate convergence (IP SLA / track if used)
